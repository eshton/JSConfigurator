# Javascript configuration holder class
I often come across in my JS application that there are a lots of configuration values I want to pass from the server to my Javascript application. This small class was intended to solve this problem in an easy and clear way.

# How to use
## Create a new config object
Without parameters
`var config = new JSConfigurator('default', {});`

With some default parameters
`var config = new JSConfigurator('default', {
  loaderImageUrl:  '/images/loader.gif',
  ajaxRefreshTime: 1000
});`
